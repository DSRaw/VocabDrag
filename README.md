# KanjiDrag
A WIP Drag and Drop Game to aid in learning Kanji

2017/10/08 Version 0.0.1a
  Changes:
  Added some test variables and values for future utilization with GUI callbacks and program logic
  Created new module named deck_converter
  Changed version-control naming convention in README
  
  Details:
  There is currently some test data and some junk data in kanji_main. I have commented out some of the larger changes, but left some of     the currently unused, but potentially utilizable variables and data.
  
  the deck_converter module is currently primarily a GUI. It's future use will be to provide a window from which a user can select an Anki   deck and convert it into a format more elegantly usable by the KanjiDrag game.

  Note to Self:
  Comments could definitely use a major overhaul to comply with pythonic standards and improve readability/ease in hiding comments

2017/05/08 Version 0.0.0a
  Committed basic skeleton of GUI.
